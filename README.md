# license-plate-trainer

This is a sample project that I developed out of initial interest in Android development. The core of the game is 
memorization training using a combination of numbers and letters.

I used to be a private investigator and was required to memorize license plates while on surveillance operations. Eventually, I plan 
to add additional features that will be relevant for surveillance professionals to enhance memory recall while on an operation.

Some initial goals:
- Import a database of license plate images to display numbers for a more realistic game
- Build a score tracking system that can keep track of total games played over time
- Implement better app visuals and animations for gamification in order to enhance the memorization aspect
- Implement account sign-in capability and data storage in the cloud

Longer term goals:
- Add videos of license plates as well as mirror image display capability for countersurveillance and surveillance detection training
- Monetize the app for private investigators, law enforcement agencies, and surveillance professionals
- Continue to add relevant features for the professional surveillance professional community
